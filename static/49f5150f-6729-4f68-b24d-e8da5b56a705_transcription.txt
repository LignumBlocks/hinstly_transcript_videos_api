the first year blew up so we're going to do a part two of the money mistakes that you were making that are literally costing you hundreds of thousands of dollars this is a psh you weren't going to want to watch this video the first one we're gonna talk about is buying whole life insurance this is almost always a scam and if it's being recommended to you by your financial advisor know that it's probably because they are making a giant ass commission on it it varies but it can sometimes be eighty to one hundred percent of the entire first year premiums that you pay that's a big incentive the problem here is it's usually someone you know or someone you trust that is selling this to you so it creates this familiarity bias they try to sell it to you saying that it offers tax advantages but so does your four o one k ira or less per year tfs say they also try to sell you want to be telling you it's invested and it can grow for you but the investments are usually conservative and eaten up by astronomical fees that make them rich not you if you buy term insurance and then invest on your own that will make you rich and not the sales person number two is waiting to be debt free before you invest it this is a huge one only in the lower and middle classes do we believe that debt is morally wrong whereas the rich know that debt when at a low interest rate or used to advance yourself is actually leverage too many people are prioritizing being debt free leaving tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table by investing sooner and not letting time just do it's thing time is your most valuable resource when it comes to investing not money number three thinking your home is an investment most people's houses their best investments simply because it's their only investment unless you bought your home with a wealth-building strategy like house hawking renting it out or flipping it your home as a shelter even if it goes up in value without a strategy to take that money out you're just living in your money yes you can sell it but where are you expecting to live if all of the houses in that area have gone up similarly real estate it's an amazing investment the way most people buy their homes it is not and this false belief that your home will take care of you instead of you taking care of it is causing people to lose out on large sums of money by not actually investing i have like twenty more of these you guys are going to need to stay true because i'm going to need to make this a series if you want to learn more right now we have some free trainings available check can buy or you can apply to work with me personally
