i used to be the queen of spending money even when i knew that i shouldn't to the point where i was putting myself into debt just literally buying random useless stuff i would have a closet full of clothes with tags on them my drawers would be overflowing with makeup that i would literally never wear or wear once and then never use again and what i realized is that there were a few really big reasons for this and when i was able to understand what these were i was able to start saving money effortlessly i saved my first hundred thousand dollars by twenty five i paid off forty thousand dollars of debt in eighteen months i was able to use money to buy my dream home to pay for my wedding and cat all because they learned how to stop self sabotaging and getting in my own damn way so here are the things that i learned the first thing was i used to see saving money as a sacrifice i thought every dollar that i didn't spend today was an experience or a thing that i was missing out on but i didn't realize though is that a sacrifice is giving something up and getting nothing back in return when you save money or you invest your money you are actually giving future you the life you wish you had today so in my eyes that's not actually a sacrifice that's a gift now this is obviously just the first step in my money-saving journey the next thing that i really had to understand was that i had really wishy washy goals if i even had any at all i thought i wanted more money but i didn't really understand what more money meant to me when you have wishy-washy goals and you lack specificity in what it is that you want out of life it's really hard to work towards it so instead of saying i want to save money what do you want to save money for and have really huge tip that helped me a lot here was actually setting up a high yield savings account with different savings buckets and then naming each one of those buckets for my specific goal so if i was going to be saving for a new car i would have a savings bucket called new car or a trip that i was going on like bali twenty twenty five then i would set up automatic transfers into these accounts every time i got paid so this way i took my mind out of it i got out in front of self sabotaged i was waiting until the end of the two weeks before my next paycheck being like okay do i have money to put away for these things that i want and it becomes that much harder to take from those accounts because you actually see yourself stealing from the life that you want the next thing i really had to understand was just how much money was going towards impulse purchases and buying shit that i didn't need so what i want you to do for the next few weeks is keep a tally every time you see something that you want to buy i want you to go put it on a list write down how much it is and at the end of those two weeks i want you to tally up how much money you would have spent on all of that shit and i want you to ask yourself if you even remember what half of those things are if you even want them anymore i cannot tell you how many times i would be scrolling through tick talking like oh my god i need that new lip combo so i'll go over to amazon i'll put it in my basket i will not buy it and if i go back in two weeks and i don't even remember what that was in therefore then i know that that was a bad purchase once you have that total of how much money you have been wasting on average say every two weeks i want you to multiply that out and see what it would be annually and then i want you throw those numbers into a compound interest calculator to see how much money you could have if you invested that instead of letting it fly out of your life on shit that you don't really need remember spending money is not the enemy but spending out of alignment with our values and our goals as so many of us think that we are buying happiness when we're going out and buying these things but in reality we're actually buying ourselves sadness we are sad that we're not further ahead in life we're sad that we're not hitting our financial goal but if your shopping is preventing you from getting there then you are the one standing in the way of getting the life that you want and i know this is going to be hard to hear but no one is coming to save you but you
