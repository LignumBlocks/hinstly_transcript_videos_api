i used to be the queen of spending money even when i knew that i shouldn't to the point where i was putting myself into dad just literally buying random useless stuff i would have a closet full of close with tags on the my drawers would be overflowing with make up that i would literally never were or were once in a never use again and what i realize is that there were a few really big reasons for this and when i was able to understand what these were i was able to start saving money effortlessly i save my first hundred thousand dollars by twenty five a pita forty thousand dollars of debt and eighteen months i was able to use money to buy my dream home to pay for my wedding and cat all because they learn how to stop self sabotaging and getting in my own damn way so here are the things that i learned the first thing was i used to see saving money as a sacrifice i thought every dollar that i didn't spend today was an experience or thing that i was missing out on but i didn't realize though is that a sacrifice is giving something up and getting nothing back and return when you save money or you invest your money you're actually giving future you the life you wish you had today so in my eyes and that's not actually a sacrifice that's a gift now this is obviously just the first step in my money saving journey the next thing that i really had to understand was that i hadn't really wishy washy goals if i even had any at all i thought i wanted more money but i didn't really understand what more money meant to me when you have wishy washy goals and you like specificity and what it is that you want out of life it's really hard to work towards it so instead of saying i want to save money what do you want to save money for and it really huge tip that helped me a lot here was actually setting up a high yield savings account with different savings buckets and then naming each one of those pockets for my specific goal so if i was going to be saving for a new car i would have a savings bucky called a new car or a trip that i was going on like bali twenty twenty five then it would set up automatic transfer as into these accounts every time he got paid so this way i took my mind out of it i got out in front of self sabotage i wasn't waiting until the end of the two weeks before my next paycheck being like okay do i have money to put away for these things that i want and it becomes that much harder to take from those accounts because you actually see yourself stealing from the life that you won the next thing you really had to understand was just how much money was going towards impulse purchases and buying shit that i didn't mean to what i want you to do for the next few weeks is keep a tally every time you see something that you want to buy i want you to go put it on a list right out how much it is and at the end of those two weeks i want you to tally up how much money you would have spent on all about shit and i want you to ask yourself if you even remember what half of those things are if you even want them anymore i cannot tell you how many times i would be scrolling through take talking like only gonna need that new lip combo so i'll go over to amazon or put it in my basket i will not buy it and if i go back in two weeks and i don't even remember what that was in therefore than a know that that was a bad purchase once you have a total of how much money you have been wasting on average say every two weeks i want you multiply that out and see what it would be annually and then i want you throw those numbers into a compound interest calculator to see how much money you could have if you invested that instead of letting it fly out of your life on shit that you don't really need remember spending money is not the enemy but spending out of alignment with her values and our goals as so many of us think that we are buying happiness when we're going out and buying these things but in reality were actually buying ourselves sadness we are sad that we're not for their headlights were sad that we're not hitting our financial goals but if you're shopping is preventing you from getting their than you were the ones standing in the way of getting the like that you want and i know this is gonna be hard to hear but no one is coming to save you but you
